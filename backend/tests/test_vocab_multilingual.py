This is not a nice-to-have. The heuristic is what runs when no API key is
configured, which is the default free deployment — so for most installs it
IS the triage engine, not a fallback.

It previously held English and romanised-Hindi terms only. A report typed in
Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati or Gurmukhi matched nothing and
fell through to MEDIUM. "व्यक्ति बेहोश है, सांस नहीं आ रही" — unconscious,
not breathing — ranked below a power cut, so volunteers saw it below alerts
